## App Description

This app allows users to find food trucks in their local area. The food trucks are displayed on a generated Google Maps screen, with icons for each truck. Whenever the user 
clicks on an Icon it will display an info window that shows the name of the Food Truck and the type of food the truck offers. 

## Current Version

Weâ€™re going to build a modern messaging app where users can sign up and log in to chat.
